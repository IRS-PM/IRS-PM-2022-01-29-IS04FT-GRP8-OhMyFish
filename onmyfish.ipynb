      "Salt should be added to the hospital tank, again at the ratio of 1 teaspoon per gallon of water. \n",
      "Low levels of salt in the water aid in the osmotic balance of the fish by making the water salinity closer to the fish's blood salinity. \n",

      "cause - Most commonly, fish popeye is caused by an injury, an infection, or poor water conditions in the aquarium.\n",
      "If only one eye is affected (unilateral), it is likely that the condition is caused by an injury rather than a problem with the water chemistry. \n",
      "This is particularly true if only one fish in a community tank is exhibiting popeye. \n",
      "A swollen eye can be the outcome of a fight with another fish, or your fish could have scraped its eye against an abrasive object in the tank. \n",
      "If this happens, look for damage to the eyeâa dead giveaway that exophthalmia is the result of an injury. \n",
      "In most injuries, the protruding eye will eventually recede as it heals.\n",
      "However, the fish should be monitored closely, as infection can ensue, causing the fish to lose sight in the affected eye.\n",
      "Another cause of popeye is an infection.\n",
      "This is most likely seen in both eyes. \n",
      "Infection may be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. \n",
      "If the fish suffers from both popeye and dropsy (edema of the belly), the prognosis is bleak. \n",
      "Internal problems, such as kidney failure or a metabolic issue can result in fluid build-up, making it extremely hard to treat your fish.\n",
      "Poor water conditions can also contribute to popeye and fish that are sensitive will be affected first. \n",
      "If one or more fish in your tank presents with popeye, test your water to determine if something is amiss with its chemistry. \n",
      "Also consider supersaturation of gas in the water, which can be seen as tiny bubbles on the sides of the aquarium and even in the fish's skin. \n",
      "This can cause gas to accumulate in the eyes and make them swell\n",
      "treatment - Treatment for popeye will depend upon the underlying cause. \n",
      "If the eye has been injured, it will typically heal on its own, as long as the fish does not develop a secondary infection or become stressed. \n",
      "You can help the fish recover by performing palliative care using aquarium salt while the eye heals (unless contraindicated). \n",
      "This helps to relieve the swelling. \n",
      "You should also remove any tank decorations that might contribute to further injuries, such as rough or sharp rocks, pointed plants, and decorative items with rough or pointed edges.\n",

      "Regular water changes and the monitoring of water chemistry are also recommended throughout the recovery time, as poor water condition is a common cause of popeye, as well as other fish ailments. \n",

      "cause - This disorder can be caused by many issues, spanning from environment to feeding problems, including the following:\n",
      "Rapidly eating, overeating, constipation, or gulping air may occur with floating foods to cause an extended belly and displace the swim bladder. \n",
      "Eating freeze-dried or dry flake food that expands when it becomes wet can also lead to an enlarged stomach or intestinal tract.\n",
      "Other abdominal organs may become enlarged and affect the swim bladder. \n",
      "Cysts in the kidneys, fatty deposits in the liver, or egg binding in female fish can result in sufficient enlargement to affect the swim bladder.\n",

      "Parasites or bacterial infections can inflame the swim bladder as well.\n",

      "Rarely fish are born with birth defects that affect the swim bladder, but in these cases, symptoms are usually present at an early age.\n",
      "treatment - Treatment involves water maintenance, feeding changes, and possible antibiotics.\n",
      "Let the fish fast: If an enlarged stomach or intestine is thought to be the cause of a swim bladder disorder, the first course of action is to not feed the fish for three days.\n",
      "Fix the water temperature: At the same time the fish is fasting, increase the water temperature to 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit and leave it there during treatment.\n",
      "Feed the fish peas: On the fourth day, feed the fish a cooked and skinned pea. \n",
      "Frozen peas are ideal for this, as they can be microwaved or boiled for a few seconds to thaw them, resulting in the proper consistency (not too soft but not too firm).\n",
      "Antibiotics: If an infection is thought to be the cause of a fish's swim bladder disorder, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic may help, and for this, you'll need to visit your veterinarian.\n",
      "Other supportive treatments (regardless of the cause) can include the following:\n",
      "Keep the water especially clean and temperatures between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      "Add a small amount of aquarium salt to the tank.\n",
      "Reduce the water level to make it easier for the fish to move around within the tank.\n",
      "Reduce water flow in tanks with a strong current.\n",
      "If the affected fish floats with part of its body constantly exposed to the air, applying a bit of Stress Coat water conditioner (which helps improve the fish's slime coat) can help avoid the development of sores and reddened spots.\n",

      "The \"worm\" part extending out into the water is actually the female reproductive structures.\r\n",
      "Anchor worms occur when a new fish is added to an aquarium carrying juvenile anchor worms or a reproductively-active female in their skin. \r\n",

      "Anchor worm juveniles can also be spread with the introduction of live plants. \r\n",
      "Aquatic plants can bring parasites like anchor worm into your aquarium if not properly quarantined.\n",

      "They will need to remove the entire parasite including the feeding end from under the fishâs skin. \r\n",

      "Once the mature females have been removed, you may still have a microscopic problem: the juvenile stages. \r\n",
      "Over-the-counter \"anchor worm\" treatments are usually fairly effective against the juvenile stages, but they will not kill the adults. \r\n",
      "Another way of killing the free-swimming juvenile stage in the aquarium can be accomplished by removing your substrate and decor and running your water through a UV light.\r\n",
      "Treating anchor worms with organophosphates or diflubenzuron (dimilin) is effective, but needs to be undertaken with severe caution. \r\n",

      "Incorrect diet is a major player. While many fish are extremely versatile in their eating habits, some foods simply do not suit some fish.\r\n",
      "Surface feeding plays a role, especially in goldfish. Goldfish are phyostomous, with a duct between the swim bladder and the oesophagus, for the purpose of getting air into the swim bladder.\r\n",
      "When goldfish feed on floating flakes or pellets, they are prone to swallowing down gulps of air with them. Once inside them, it not only interferes with digestion but also causes buoyancy issues.\r\n",

      "cause - Of the water mold class Oomycetes, Saprolengniaceae is a family that contains many species commonly called \"saprolegnia.\" \r\n",
      "There are so many different species that every freshwater fish is susceptible to some Saprolegnia species. \r\n",
      "Typically, water molds feed on dead organic materials and replicate by forming spores. \r\n",
      "These spores seed a substrate and float about, waiting for a bit of dead tissue to inhabit and grow into. \r\n",
      "Dead skin cells on fish with injuries or weakened immune systems make ideal hosts.\r\n",
      "Saprolegnia is an opportunistic pathogen that will likely infect fishes that are living poor water quality, wrong temperatures (eg tropical fishes in cold water) or are immunosuppressed by other infections or even high stress.\n",
      "treatment - It is imperative that Saprolegnia be properly diagnosed by an aquatic veterinarian prior to treatment. \r\n",
      "Water mold can look very similar to Columnaris bacteria and will require a completely different treatment. \r\n",
      "Your vet will do a skin mucus scrape or swab culture to determine the problematic pathogen.\r\n",
      "Since it is a water mold, it is not responsive to antibiotics. \r\n",
      "However, there may be a bacterial infection that caused the fish to be weak initially, allowing the Saprolegnia to grow on it. \r\n",
      "You may need to treat for both bacterial infections and the Saprolegnia fungus, using different medications.\r\n",
      "Severe infectious may require treatment specific to the water mold, using and antifungal medication in the water.\n",

      "cause - Saltwater Ich is almost always present in the water of wild caught fish and are easily transmitted on anything wet.  This causes Saltwater Ich to exist in the holding tanks of fish wholesalers and distributors.  The parasites will then make their way to your local pet store and from there they will enter your home aquarium.\n",
      "treatment - Quarantine all fish, coral and invertebrates for at least 45 to 90 days or preventive medicine treatment could mitigate the risk of Saltwater Ich outbreaks. \r\n",
      "The two most proven and effective treatments for Marine Ich are Chloroquine Phosphate and Copper Sulfate based medications. CP or pharmaceutical grade Chloroquine Phosphate requires a prescription from a veterinarian, so this leads most hobbyists to use copper treatments. The CP that is available online from eBay and other websites is rarely medical grade and not worth the risk to your fish.\r\n",
      "Copper is a poison and has been compared to chemotherapy for fish. It is often deadly to fish at unregulated levels or if a fish is too weak when the treatment begins. Purchasing a reliable copper test kit is absolutely required if you intend to use any copper medications on your fish.\r\n",
      "Cupramine from Seachem is a very popular choice that contains ionic copper. Cupramine has the advantage of mixing much easier into the water than some other products. The Cupramine therapeutic level is 0.50 ppm and should only be read with the Seachem or Salifert copper test kit.\r\n",
      "Prime, Amguard or other ammonia binding products should be avoided while using Cupramine because they have been reported to increase the mortality rate of fish during treatment.\r\n",
      "Coppersafe is a much older liquid option that contains chelated copper with a therapeutic level between 1.5 â 2.0 ppm. The API test kit is recommended for this treatment and you are able to use ammonia binding products. However, there are reports that it less effective than some other options.\r\n",
      "Cuprion from Brightwell Aquatics is another ionic copper liquid-based treatment. The therapeutic level is 0.20 ppm. Seachem or Salifert copper test kit is recommended again for this product and ammonia binders should be avoided.\r\n",
      "Copper Power Blue is advertised as the safest treatment for Saltwater Ich. The therapeutic level between 1.5 â 2.0 ppm for Copper Power, but they claim 2.5ppm is also safe. The API test kit is recommended for monitoring this product.\n",

      "environment - Saltwater\n",
      "affectfish - nan\n",
      "cause - In freshwater fish, Velvet is caused by either OÃ¶dinium pillularis or OÃ¶dinium limneticum. \r\n",
      "In marine fish, AmyloÃ¶dinium ocellatum causes the dreaded Coral Fish Disease. \r\n",
      "All three species have symptoms and life cycles similar to the well-known ciliated protozoan parasite, Ich.\r\n",
      "Like Ich, OÃ¶dinium may be present in most commercial aquariums, but only becomes a problem when the fish are stressed by poor quality water, changes in the water temperature, or being transported.\n",
      "treatment - Chloroquine phosphate is the treatment of choice for velvet, but copper also works if symptoms are caught early on. \r\n",
      "Tank transfer and hyposalinity do not work with velvet. \r\n",
      "A freshwater dip and/or chemical bath (discussed in more detail below) is recommended either before or during treatment, due to the severity of this disease; however these would only provide temporary relief and will not eradicate velvet.Tank fallow period of 6 weeks is advisable.Formalin â Cheap, effective and readily available; formalin can sometimes even be sourced from a vet or local pharmacy (37% Formaldehyde is what youâre looking for). However, the downsides are numerous: First, it can be very harsh â some fish cannot even survive in it the full 60 minutes. Formalin will quickly deplete oxygen from the water, so itâs important to aerate heavily for 30 minutes before and also during the bath treatment. The bath should be done in a large glass bowl/container or small aquarium, as plastic may absorb some of the medication and then leach it back out during future use. Finally, formalin is a known carcinogen, so precautions must be taken when handling it. Prevent your skin from coming into contact with it by wearing waterproof gloves, and protect your face by wearing a face mask and eye protection.\r\n",
      "Acriflavine â  It has a broad range of effect, being effective against both protozoans and bacterial infections. The latter gives it an advantage over using formalin, because all those tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet have the potential to get infected. You can also leave a fish in acriflavine longer than formalin, because it is not as harsh on the fish. Dosage varies by the product you are using, but for straight acriflavine (Acriflavine-MS) use 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water for a bath solution.\r\n",
      "Methylene Blue â May be added to the formalin bath only. It is a healing agent, useful for treating the tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet.\r\n",
      "Chloroquine phosphate/copper â While all of the above will remove the vast majority of velvet on a fish, some will inevitably survive. Within 4 days the remaining trophonts will drop off the fish, then encyst, and usually 48-96 hours later (although it can take up to 20+ days depending upon the strain) release dinospores (free swimmers) seeking to reinfect fish. The presence of CP or copper at therapeutic levels kills the dinospores, effectively shielding your fish from reinfection. It is important to note that CP/copper does not eradicate any other stage of velvet, just dinospores. It has zero impact on the parasites on the fish; they must âweather the stormâ until the trophonts fall off. This is why it is so important to do a freshwater dip and chemical bath beforehand, to reduce the number of parasites feeding on your fishâs body & gills.\r\n",
      "Wide spectrum antibiotic â Velvet does A LOT of damage to a fishâs skin & gills. The trophont sits on the skinâs surface and puts out small rhyzoids (root-like structures) into the skin of the host where it absorbs nutrients directly from the fishâs skin. With all those tiny wounds, the likelihood of infection is high. This is something I missed in my earlier experiments where the fish died. Therefore, I consider it prudent to preemptively treat withKanaplex and/or Furan-2 to ward off any potential bacterial infections which might arise.\n",
